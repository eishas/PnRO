In April, 1996, the National Science Foundation convened a workshop for faculty,
students, academic administrators, publishers, and industry professionals to discuss the
use of information technology in higher education. The purpose of the meeting was: 1) to
identify prevailing themes and issues in the use of information technology and begin to
establish a common vocabulary for discussion; 2) to derive a general consensus on
effective and ineffective attributes and examples of information technology; and 3) to
initiate discussion on the role each stakeholder might play in a national effort to use such
technologies to enrich the educational experience of all undergraduates.
